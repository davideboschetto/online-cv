career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I lead the AI technical developments from the R&D software group at Microtec and Biometic, improving the grading capabilities 
      of our software libraries with massive usage of AI algorithms.
      I've moved to this sector after two a brief stints as Freelance Computer Vision Engineer at Hawkeye Innovations and as Data 
      Scientist (working on NLP) and a PhD obtained on appling Machine Learning to biomedical computer vision. 
      I still enjoy participating to competition and challenges in the biomedical field.
